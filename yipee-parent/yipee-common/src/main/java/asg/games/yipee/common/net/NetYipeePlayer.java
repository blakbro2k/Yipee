/**
 * Marker interface for a network-serializable Yipee player object.
 *
 * <p>This interface exists to unify different player representations across platforms
 * (e.g., core, LibGDX, or GWT) without introducing tight coupling. It allows shared
 * serialization and polymorphism in the networking layer while decoupling platform-specific
 * implementations like `YipeePlayer` and `YipeePlayerGDX`.
 *
 * <p>Typically used in packet definitions and cross-platform communication.
